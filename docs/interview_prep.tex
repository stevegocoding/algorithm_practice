\textbf{Worst case}:  In the most unbalanced case, a single Quicksort call involves \(O(n)\) work plus two recursive calls on lists of size \(0\) and \(n-1\), so the recurrence relation is: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split} 
T(n)& = O(n) + T(0) + T(n-1) \\
	& = O(n) + T(n-1) \\
	& = O(n^2)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Average}: In the most balanced case, a single quicksort call involves \(O(n)\) work plus two recursive calls on lists of size \(n/2\), so the recurrence relation is: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split} 
T(n)& = O(n) + 2T(\frac{n}{2}) \\
	& = O(n \log{n}) 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
